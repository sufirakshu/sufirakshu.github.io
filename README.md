# sufirakshu.github.io

This is the repo for my website sufirakshu.com, that I'm building from scratch, using HTML5 and CSS3 for now. I might add more technologies as the website (and my learning) evolves. 

Note to self: My intention is to:
> Keep the code as simple as possible.
> Keep the site as functional as possible.
> Keep the design interactive, but simple - Use your gut feeling on how much of design and interactivity you put on these pages of code.

All the best!
